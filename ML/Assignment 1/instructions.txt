Instructions
Follow the instructions in each question carefully.
A Jupyter notebook along with output for each cell is expected.
Any assignment submitted using  other python IDEs are not considered for grading.
Use appropriate labels for all visualizations.
Upload the output.csv file along with the notebook when required.
Question 1
 

Consider the following dataset and follow the instructions

Import the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease . (1 points).(Hint: Convert txt to csv for ease of use.)
Identify the columns with missing values (1 point).
Extract X as all columns except the first column and Y as first column. (1 point). Perform 10 fold cross validation. (1 point)
Visualize the dataset using two appropriate plots. (2 points)
Split the data into training set and testing set. (1 points)
Train a Logistic regression model for the dataset. (1 points)
Display the coefficients and form the logistic regression equation. (2 point)
Compute the accuracy and confusion matrix. (2 points)
Plot the decision boundary and test results. (1 point)
Question 2
Considering the Census Income data with response variable as Income(>50k and <=50k).

Import the csv dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income (Links to an external site.) (1 points).
Identify the presence of missing values, fill the missing values with mean for numerical attributes and mode value for categorical attributes. (2 points)
Visualize the dataset. (1 points)
Extract X as all columns except the Income column and Y as Income column. (1 points)
Split the data into training set and testing set. (1 points)
Model and train the classifier using GaussianNB, BernoulliNB. (2 points)
Compute the accuracy and confusion matrix for each classifier. (2 points)
